## 🧭 Approach

The project uses a modular React + Vite setup where main.jsx initializes the app and App.jsx handles layout and routing. Components are organized in src/components/ for reusability, with assets in src/assets/ and global styles in index.css. React hooks manage state, props handle data flow, and ESLint ensures clean code. The structure is lightweight yet scalable, allowing easy integration of React Router, Context API/Redux, or JavaScript.
